# Personal Portfolio website 

Standard portfolios are boring. When it came time to showcase my work, I wanted recruiters to actually experience my software engineering skills, not just read a bulleted list. So, I built a web-based Operating System from scratch. \n\nUnder the hood, it’s powered by Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind, with Framer Motion handling the physics. But on the surface, it functions like a real desktop. I engineered a custom window manager with complex Z-index tracking, a smooth macOS-style dock, and native-feeling applications. You can open up my 'Credentials' app to see my education, open the 'Mission 34' terminal to read my project docs, or check out my 'Hobbies' in a sleek bento-box widget. It was a massive challenge in state management, but the result is a digital space that truly feels like mine.
